## Overview

This repo contains minimal, *task-focused* examples for different agent stacks. Each subfolder is an isolated playground with its own README and scripts. Use it to compare workflows, prompting patterns, tools, and deployment options side‑by‑side.

> **Why this repo?** Quickly spin up a working agent in your stack of choice, then iterate on tools, memory, retrieval, and routing.
